# Active Debugger Open Source Hardware and Firmware Projects

## Overview
The Active Debugger is an easy to use real-time streaming embedded systems debugger that makes firmware debugging a breeze.  The hardware and firmware are freely available as open-source hardware and embedded firmware in this repository. It is specifically designed for straightforward debugging with a single Active Debug Port. This tool is ideal for engineers looking to understand embedded systems through real-time data observation.

## Specifications
- **Access:** The complete hardware design and firmware of the Active Debugger are open for download, modification, and use.
- **License:** MIT License
- **Community:** We strongly encourage community involvement in the development and enhancement of the Active Debugger. Contributions to improve functionality or extend capabilities are welcome.

## Software Notice
While the Active Debugger hardware and embedded firmware are open source, the Active-Pro PC application that communicates with the Active Debugger and visualizes the debug information is proprietary. This application is necessary for interfacing with the hardware and fully utilizing its debugging capabilities.

## Active-Pro Debugger & Logic Analyzer
For those requiring more advanced debugging capabilities, consider our Active-Pro Debugger & Logic Analyzer:
- **Multiple Debug Ports:** Equipped with four Active Debug Ports, allowing for simultaneous data management and more complex debugging scenarios.
- **Integrated Tools:** Features a comprehensive suite of tools including a logic analyzer, oscilloscope, and both analog and digital signal generators.
- **Current Measurement:** Capable of measuring dynamic system current, crucial for performance optimization in power-sensitive applications.
